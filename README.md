# Doctor Appointment System Laravel

This is a Laravel-based doctor appointment web application that you may have used in your daily life to schedule a doctor’s appointment. There are three sorts of users in the booking application: patients, doctors, and administrators. The patient will be able to schedule a visit with his physician. We have a date on the frontend that allows the patient to filter the available doctors for a specific date. He can schedule an appointment for a specified time and date, which will be displayed on the patient dashboard afterwards.

The patient dashboard also displays whether or not he has seen a doctor. If he says yes, the doctor’s medicine will appear on his dashboard. He can also make changes to his profile. The doctor’s information can be created and updated by the administrator. Admin can sort through the patients to check who has scheduled an appointment on a specific date. He can change the patient’s status from visited to not visited. Admins can create, alter, and delete departments. As an administrator, he has access to the system’s information through his dashboard.
